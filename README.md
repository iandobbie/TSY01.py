# TSY01.py
Basic library to read the TSYS01 temperature sensor over i2c on a Raspberry Pi.

This is a python module to provide basic fucntions to access the TSY01 temperature sensor board over i2c from as Raspberry Pi. 
I bought a complete board from http://www.elecrow.com/tsys01-temperature-sensor-board-p-1608.html but you can also get the bare chips if you are more of a hardware hacker than me.
